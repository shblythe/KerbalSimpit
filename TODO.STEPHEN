D Get it to build in some environment.  VM?
	X Can I get KSP working in VM? - no, so build plugin in on Vbox,
		run it in Windows
D Check a branch into github
* Try moving OpenPorts to FlightReadyHandler so it only does comms in flight
	mode, this should allow upload to Arduino when not in flight
	X this didn't work, so I guess these two functions do nothing
	- is there another way?  how to KSPSerialIO do it?
- Work out what I need that's missing for each autopilot programme
